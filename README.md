# LinAlg4DataScience
Code that accompanies the book "Linear Algebra for Data Science"

I have a new book on linear algebra, published by O'Reilly.

Link to the book on amazon:
https://www.amazon.com/Practical-Linear-Algebra-Data-Science/dp/1098120612/

E-version viewable for O'Reilly members:
https://www.oreilly.com/library/view/practical-linear-algebra/9781098120603/



This repository contains all the Python code that accompanies the book. The code probably isn't useful without the book.
