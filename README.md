# LinAlg4DataScience
Code that accompanies the book "Linear Algebra for Data Science"

I have a new book on linear algebra, published by O'Reilly. The book is currently in-progress and should be completely available by November 2022.

O'Reilly provides "early release" chapters for members:

This repository contains all the Python code that accompanies the book. The code probably isn't useful without the book.
